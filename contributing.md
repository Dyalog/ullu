# Contributing Guide

We welcome contributions from anyone, even if you are new to open source. We will help you with any technical issues and help improve your contribution so that it can be merged.

Every small change of refactoring, documentation, code commenting, questions, suggestions, adding a test, adding a primitive makes the project better and will help making Dyalog APL bug free. 𓆣

## Basic Setup

To contribute, make sure your set up:

- Your username + email
- Your ~/.gitconfig
- Dyalog (preferably version >18.2 unicode)

### Fork ullu

Step 1. Create a fork of the project repository

Step 2. Clone the project repository from GitHub and set up your remote repository

```
git clone https://github.com/dyalog/ullu.git
cd ullu
git remote add REMOTE_NAME https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/ullu.git
```

`REMOTE_NAME` is the name of your remote repository and could be any name you like, for example your first name.

`YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` is your user name on GitHub and should be part of your account path.

You can use `git remote -v` to check if the new remote is set up correctly.

## Sending a Pull Request/Merge Request

Step 1. Create a new branch

```
git checkout -b fix1
```

Step 2. Make changes in relevant file(s)
Step 3. Commit the changes:

```
git add FILE1 (FILE2 ...)
git commit -m "YOUR_COMMIT_MESSAGE"
```

[Here](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/) are some great tips on writing good commit messages.

Step 4. Check to ensure that your changes look good
```
git log --pretty=oneline --graph --decorate --all
```

Step 5. Send the pull request
```
git push REMOTE_NAME fix1
```

The command will push the new branch fix1 into your remote repository REMOTE_NAME that you created earlier. Additionally, it will also display a link that you can click on to open the new pull request. After clicking on the link, write a title and a concise description then click the “Create” button.

Yay you are now all set. ٩(ˊᗜˋ*)و

## Contributing Code

### Adding a primitive

A primitive is a built-in function or operator which is a core part of the language. It is represented by a glyph, which it may share with another primitive. More information [here](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Primitive)

Ullu tests the primitives one-by-one covering all the code written in the sources of Dyalog APL, all possible cases including edge cases and all types of inputs it can receive. 

<!-- how to initialize the test files -->

<!-- demo for a primitive (blog) -->
A workflow demonstration blog on how to write tests is upcomming. Progress can be tracked [here](https://github.com/Dyalog/ullu/issues/50)

## Contributing Docs

### Decision docs

<!-- what it is -->
Decision Docs are records detailing key decisions, fostering transparency and aiding future collaboration by providing a structured account of the decision-making process. Documentation about why certain decisions were taken in the codebase, it basically explains the mindset of the developer writing the tests and it also documents all the anomalies in the codebase.

It can be found [here](https://github.com/Dyalog/ullu/tree/docs-revamp/docs/decision)

<!-- how to write -->
In the decision docs, you need to mention the types of test cases included in the tests, description of all the variations of the tests and all the edge cases that were faced/handled. It needs to have all the information that a person in the future would need to expand the same tests or write new related ones. All the decisions taken while writing the tests.

<!-- example -->
Decision docs for the primitive Magnitude are a good example of this. It can be found [here](https://github.com/Dyalog/ullu/blob/docs-revamp/docs/decision/primitive-functions/scalar-monadic.md#magnitude-rydocs)
